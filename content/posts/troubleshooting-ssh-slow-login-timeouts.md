Secure Shell (SSH) is the lifeline for remote Linux system administration, but it can occasionally frustrate with timeouts, painfully slow logins, or cryptic authentication failures. This post explores the **most common causes** and **practical fixes** for SSH connectivity issues.

---

## üîç 1. Diagnosing SSH Timeouts

**Symptom:** SSH hangs for a long time and then fails or eventually connects.

### ‚úÖ Check Network Reachability
```bash
ping <hostname>
traceroute <hostname>
telnet <hostname> 22
```

- If port 22 is blocked by a firewall or dropped silently, SSH will hang.
- Use `nmap -p 22 <host>` to verify SSH port status.

### üî• Check Firewall Rules
- On server:
```bash
sudo iptables -L -n
sudo ufw status
```

- On cloud instances (AWS, Azure, etc.): check **security groups or firewall rules**.

## üê¢ 2. Troubleshooting Slow SSH Logins

**Symptom:** SSH connects, but login takes 5‚Äì30 seconds before showing the shell.

### üîé Common Culprits

#### a) **Reverse DNS Lookups**
SSH may try to resolve the client's IP via reverse DNS.

- **Fix:** Edit the server's `sshd_config`:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
Add or change:
```bash
UseDNS no
```
Then restart SSH:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

#### b) **GSSAPI Authentication**
GSSAPI is often enabled by default but rarely used.

- Disable it in `sshd_config`:
```bash
GSSAPIAuthentication no
```

- Also disable it in your SSH client config (optional):
```bash
Host *
  GSSAPIAuthentication no
```

#### c) **Authentication Delay from PAM or LDAP**
If using external authentication (like LDAP), failures or timeouts here can delay logins.

- Inspect:
```bash
sudo journalctl -xe
cat /var/log/auth.log
```

- You might see entries like `pam_ldap: ldap_search() timed out`.

## ‚ùå 3. Debugging Authentication Failures

**Symptom:** You get `Permission denied`, `Authentication failed`, or `Too many authentication failures`.

### üß™ Enable SSH Client Debug
```bash
ssh -vvv user@host
```

Look for lines like:
```
debug1: Offering public key: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password
```

### ‚úÖ Common Fixes

#### a) **Wrong Permissions on `.ssh` Files**
```bash
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

#### b) **Too Many SSH Keys Offered**
Some servers reject connections after too many failed key attempts.

- Use:
```bash
ssh -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -i ~/.ssh/my_key user@host
```

#### c) **Server Doesn't Accept Your Key**
- Make sure your **public key** (`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) is in the server‚Äôs:
```
~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

- And ownership is correct:
```bash
chown -R user:user ~/.ssh
```

## üõ°Ô∏è 4. SSHD Logs Are Your Friend

Check logs on the **server side**:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u sshd
tail -f /var/log/auth.log
```

Look for:
- Authentication errors
- Key mismatch
- PAM rejections
- Reverse DNS failures

---

## üí° Pro Tip: Enable SSH Logging in Detail

In `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
```bash
LogLevel VERBOSE
```
This logs key fingerprints and helps debug why a key might be rejected.

---

## üß∞ Final Tips

- Restart SSH after changes:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

- Always keep a **backup session open** when testing configs.
- Use `ssh-copy-id` to easily push keys:
```bash
ssh-copy-id user@host
```
