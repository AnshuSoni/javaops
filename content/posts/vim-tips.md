# ⚡ Cool Vim Tips and Tricks Every Developer Should Know

## 1. Use Relative Line Numbers

Enable relative line numbers for easy navigation:

```vim
:set relativenumber
```

**Benefit**: Jump 5 lines up/down with `5k` / `5j` without guessing.

---

## 2. Split Windows like a Pro

- Horizontal split:
  ```vim
  :split filename
  ```
- Vertical split:
  ```vim
  :vsplit filename
  ```

Navigate between splits:
```vim
Ctrl-w h  (left)
Ctrl-w l  (right)
Ctrl-w k  (up)
Ctrl-w j  (down)
```

**Benefit**: Edit multiple files simultaneously!

---

## 3. Faster Search and Highlight

- Search forward:
  ```vim
  /pattern
  ```
- Search backward:
  ```vim
  ?pattern
  ```
- Clear highlights:
  ```vim
  :noh
  ```

**Tip**: After a search, use `n` to find next, `N` for previous.

---

## 4. Use Macros for Repetitive Tasks

Record a macro:

```vim
qa  # Start recording into register 'a'
<do your actions>
q   # Stop recording
```

Replay:

```vim
@a
```

Replay multiple times:

```vim
10@a
```

**Benefit**: Automate tedious repetitive edits!

---

## 5. Visual Block Mode (Awesome for Columns)

Enter **block selection** mode:

```vim
Ctrl-v
```

Select columns, then:
- **Insert text**: Press `I`, type, and press `Esc`.
- **Delete/replace**: Select and act!

**Use case**: Edit multiple lines at once, like adding `//` at start.

---

## 6. Use Buffers Instead of Closing Files

- List open buffers:
  ```vim
  :ls
  ```
- Switch between buffers:
  ```vim
  :bnext
  :bprev
  :b buffer_number
  ```

**Benefit**: Keep files open in memory and switch fast!

---

## 7. Surround Plugin (Add parentheses, quotes quickly)

Using `vim-surround`:
- Change `"word"` to `'word'`:
  ```vim
  cs"'
  ```
- Delete surrounding parentheses:
  ```vim
  ds)
  ```

**Plugin**: `tpope/vim-surround`

---

## 8. Fast Commenting

With `vim-commentary`:

- Comment a line:
  ```vim
  gcc
  ```
- Comment a selection:
  ```vim
  gc
  ```

**Plugin**: `tpope/vim-commentary`

---

## 9. Persistent Undo History

Enable undo even after closing Vim:

Add to `.vimrc`:

```vim
set undofile
set undodir=~/.vim/undodir
```

**Benefit**: Recover mistakes even after days!

---

## 10. Quick Save and Exit Shortcuts

- Save:
  ```vim
  :w
  ```
- Save and quit:
  ```vim
  :wq
  ```
- Quit without saving:
  ```vim
  :q!
  ```

**Pro Tip**: Map it shorter in `.vimrc`:

```vim
nnoremap <leader>w :w<CR>
nnoremap <leader>q :q<CR>
```

---

# 🚀 Bonus: Power User Tricks

- **Paste without overwriting clipboard**:
  ```vim
  "_dP
  ```
- **Move lines up and down**:
  - Visual select lines, then:
    ```vim
    :m '>+1
    :m '<-2
    ```
- **Open Vim at a specific line**:
  ```bash
  vim +45 filename
  ```
- **Edit with sudo after opening**:
  ```vim
  :w !sudo tee %
  ```

---

# 🧐 Final Tip: Personal `.vimrc` Essentials

```vim
syntax on
set number relativenumber
set tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 expandtab
set incsearch ignorecase smartcase
set clipboard=unnamedplus
```

> **Tip**: Your `.vimrc` is your superpower. Keep it minimal but efficient!
