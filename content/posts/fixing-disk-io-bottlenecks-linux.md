Disk I/O bottlenecks can severely impact the performance of Linux systems, especially for databases, file servers, or virtualized environments. This post covers how to **identify**, **analyze**, and **fix** disk I/O performance issues with commonly available tools and best practices.

---

## 🚨 Symptoms of Disk I/O Bottlenecks

- High system load (`load average`) with low CPU usage
- Sluggish application response
- `iowait` spikes in `top`
- Delayed file writes or reads
- Unresponsive processes during disk activity

---

## 🔍 Step 1: Identify the Bottleneck

### ✅ Use `iostat`
```bash
iostat -xz 1
```

Key metrics to observe:
- `%util`: 100% = fully saturated disk
- `await`: average I/O wait time in ms
- `svctm`: service time; if `await` >> `svctm`, there’s queuing
- `tps`: transfers per second (may be high under load)

### ✅ Use `iotop` to Trace I/O-Heavy Processes
```bash
sudo iotop
```

Sort by I/O to find the culprit processes causing disk pressure.

### ✅ Use `dstat` for Real-Time Multi-Resource View
```bash
dstat -cdngy
```

---

## 🧪 Step 2: Analyze I/O Patterns

### 🧾 Random vs Sequential Access

- Databases → Random I/O
- File copying → Sequential I/O

Use `blktrace` and `btt` for advanced tracing.

### 📈 Monitor with `ioping`
```bash
ioping -c 10 /mount/point
```

Test latency and responsiveness of a disk path.

## 🛠️ Step 3: Fixing Disk I/O Bottlenecks

### 🧹 1. Clean Temporary Files and Logs
```bash
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=7d
sudo rm -rf /var/tmp/*
```

### 🔁 2. Change I/O Scheduler

Check current scheduler:
```bash
cat /sys/block/sdX/queue/scheduler
```

Switch to `mq-deadline` or `none` (for SSDs):
```bash
echo mq-deadline | sudo tee /sys/block/sdX/queue/scheduler
```

### 🧵 3. Tune `vm.dirty_ratio` and `swappiness`
```bash
sysctl vm.dirty_ratio=10
sysctl vm.swappiness=10
```

Reduce dirty pages and swap usage to lower write bursts.

### 📂 4. Mount with Optimal Options
```bash
mount -o noatime,nodiratime /dev/sdX1 /mnt
```

Disabling access time updates can reduce unnecessary writes.

## 🛡️ Step 4: Hardware and Storage Optimizations

- **Use faster disks (NVMe/SSD)** for high-random workloads
- **RAID configuration**: Use RAID 10 for speed + redundancy
- **LVM striping**: Improves throughput for large files
- **Check SMART health**:
```bash
sudo smartctl -a /dev/sdX
```

---

## 📌 Bonus: Monitor Disk Health Over Time

### 🛠 Use `collectl`, `atop`, or `Grafana + node_exporter` for visualization.

```bash
collectl -sD -oT
```

## ✅ Summary

| Tool       | Purpose                             |
|------------|-------------------------------------|
| iostat     | General disk performance metrics    |
| iotop      | Find top I/O-consuming processes    |
| ioping     | Measure disk latency                |
| smartctl   | Disk health check                   |
| sysctl     | Kernel tuning for memory and I/O    |

Disk I/O problems can appear subtle at first but compound quickly. By combining the right tools with sensible kernel tuning and hardware choices, you can eliminate bottlenecks and restore snappy performance.
